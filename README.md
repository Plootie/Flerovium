# Flerovium

This powershell script is designed to repeatedly launch Helldivers 2, Look for *any* GameGuard error and if found, close the game and try again.
This is an attempt to make launching the game less tedious for those suffering from the 114 Error that are unable to rollback their UEFI while they wait on an official fix.

## Disclaimer
I wrote this script in less than an evening and will almost certainly have issues.
Feel free to report any problems in the Issues section and I'll attempt to fix them for you.
